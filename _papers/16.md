# Paper abstract 
abstract: "There are explanation methods, as well as works that quantify the extent to which these explanations satisfy properties, like faithfulness or robustness. For instance, SmoothGrad \cite{smilkov_smoothgrad_2017}
encourages robustness by averaging gradients around an input,  whereas LIME \cite{ribeiro_why_2016}
encourages fidelity by fitting a linear approximation of a function. 
However, we demonstrate that these forms of encouragement do not consistently target their desired properties.  In this paper, we \emph{directly optimize} explanations for desired properties. We show that, compared to SmoothGrad and LIME, we are able to: (1) produce explanations that are more optimal with respect to chosen properties (2) manage trade-offs between properties more explicitly and intuitively."
