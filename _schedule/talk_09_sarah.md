abstract: When machine learning models are deployed, for example in recommender systems, they can affect the distribution on which they operate. Such endogenous distribution shifts arise due to the impact of decisions on individuals, and these effects can cause issues like polarization and bias amplification. In this talk, I will discuss models of impact at a variety of levels: users consuming content, producers creating it, and learning-based services who serve it. I will draw on recent work on preference dynamics in personalized recommendation, producer competition under algorithmic curation, and multi-learner participation dynamics. Time permitting, I will introduce a perspective based on the unifying framework of dynamical systems, and outline open problems.
